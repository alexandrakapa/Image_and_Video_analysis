### Image and Video analysis 
Repository for group projects of Image and Video analysis course in Ntua ECE 2020-2021.

* 1st project:\
We were asked to implement an image pyramid and compute the entropy and SNR of the original and reconstructed images.

* 2nd project:\
We were asked to implement Harris and Shi-Tomasi corner detectors and then use Lucas-Kanade algorithm in order to compute the optical flow.

* 3rd project:\
We experimented with a classification problem using several CNN models (LeNet, AlexNet and VGG) ant tuning its parameters. We also experimented using early stoping, dropout, data augmentation etc
